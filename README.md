### Linux Magazine

*Julien : That's the best choice I think*

Yes it says Linux in the title but the topics are pretty broad (security, cloud, apache, openstack, ..)

65€ only for 12 printed issues. 80 with the (fluffy) dvd

### Linux Voice

Very interesting but more oriented on the client side. 

117€ for 12 issues printed + digital (!)

# Dev

### NFJS (no fluff just stuff)

**digital only !**

A mix of articles centered on software development. I have heard good things about this one.
